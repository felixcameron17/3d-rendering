# 3d-rendering
A more advanced 3D rendering tool I made, using projection matrixes similar to last time

You can add your own .obj files and run then by editing the file thats being run in the code.


# NOTE:

When dealing with large .obj files, the program is laggy. This is not something that can be fixed due to the nature of pygame, it is very laggy. I only made this as a proof of concept for myself to learn the math behind 3d rendering
