# 3d-rendering
A more advanced 3D rendering tool I made, using projection matrixes similar to last time

You can add your own .obj files and run then by editing the file thats being run in the code.

While the object is rendered, you can use W, A, S, D, Q and E to move and rotate the object, and Z and X to shrink or grow the object

# NOTE:

When dealing with large .obj files, the program is laggy. This is not something that can be fixed due to the nature of pygame, it is very laggy. I only made this as a proof of concept for myself to learn the math behind 3d rendering
